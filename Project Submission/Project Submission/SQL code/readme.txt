In the sql file there is a data load section, it gets local data and inserts it into the respective tables.
But, it needs the correct directory of the data csv files. Be sure to change the directoryto what it should
be on your computer. 
It should be something like ~~/Project Submission/SQL code/data
where the ~~ is your own directory
Also depending on your OS, you might have to use double backslashes \\
